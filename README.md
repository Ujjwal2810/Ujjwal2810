# Hi there, Iâ€™m Ujjwal ðŸ‘‹

I'm a final-year B.Tech student specializing in **Electronics & Communication Engineering** at **National Institute of Technology â€“ Kurukshetra** (NIT Kurukshetra). Iâ€™m passionate about digital design, hardware description languages (especially **Verilog**), and the inner workings of computing systems.

##  What Iâ€™m Building

Here are two projects I'm particularly proud of:

### 1. **WashingMachine**
A Verilog-based enhanced automatic washing machine controller featuring:
- Multiple wash cycles  
- Temperature control  
- Pause/resume capability  
- Safety measures like door-open detection  
- Comprehensive testbench for simulation and verification  

Explore it here: [WashingMachine Repository](https://github.com/Ujjwal2810/WashingMachine)

### 2. **FIFO**
A simple yet effective **First-In First-Out (FIFO) buffer** in Verilog:
- Parameterized depth and width (default: 8x8)  
- Implements a circular buffer design  
- Full and empty status flags  
- Handles overflow and underflow gracefully  
- Verified with a detailed testbench and GTKWave simulations
