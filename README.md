# Hi there, I’m Ujjwal 👋

I'm a final-year B.Tech student specializing in **Electronics & Communication Engineering** at **National Institute of Technology – Kurukshetra** (NIT Kurukshetra). I’m passionate about digital design, hardware description languages (especially **Verilog**), and the inner workings of computing systems.

##  What I’m Building

Here are two projects I'm particularly proud of:

### 1. **WashingMachine**
A Verilog-based enhanced automatic washing machine controller featuring:
- Multiple wash cycles  
- Temperature control  
- Pause/resume capability  
- Safety measures like door-open detection  
- Comprehensive testbench for simulation and verification  

Explore it here: [WashingMachine Repository](https://github.com/Ujjwal2810/WashingMachine)

### 2. **RISC-V-Processor**
Building a 5-stage pipelined **RISC-V RV32I processor**:
- Forwarding to minimize hazards  
- Hazard detection mechanisms  
- Pipeline registers for efficient instruction execution  
- Ideal as an educational resource for computer architecture studies
